Description: Pubmed is a major database and community for academic research in medicine. Public health is dependent on the ongoing updates and new developments that research delivers it, and keeping the public up-to-date on this information is vital to improving patient care and health. Publications and updates follow the ever-changing healthcare landscape, and maintaining an efficient forum to discuss topics and discoveries is foundational to the effectiveness of research. The purpose and process of prototyping is to determine the overall functionality of the application prior to the design process and perform revisions to best optimize the user experience. A list of tasks that the paper prototype of your system supported:

Feature 1: Automatic and accessible citation tool.

Feature 2: Scrolling for search results provides the summary or abstract of an article under the title so that researchers can easily determine if the article of interest is worthy of further reading.

Feature 3: Bolding or highlighting of search bar terminology within publication and article text.

Description of your decision making of the graphical interface design, including the choice of the color scheme and note if you considered/checked accessibility color contrast: In terms of graphical interface and design, my goal was to create a simple, intuitive, and clear interface to help users focus on their research. To do this, I focused on keeping essential UI items and removed potentially distracting UI elements. As a result, each element on each page of this wireframe was created intentionally with functionality, purpose, and clarity in mind. The color scheme was a conventional light blue - the usualy for healthcare based websites. This light blue was complemented by orange accents. The combination of these opposing colors provides a pleasing color scheme for the user that is not too overbearing. The wireframe passed accessibility tests for color contrast as seen in this photo (only the built-in Adobe interface that hosts the wirframe failed, which is not a part of the wireframe and is not part of the user experience; see photo).

If you have multiple versions of prototypes by reflecting the evaluation with others, provide them with the description of what you learned from otherâ€™s feedback and what you have made the changes:

Previously, when viewing the citation and abstract pages in the search results, users could not navigate between citation, abstract, and the full research article from the citation and abstract pages. This was a frustrating experience for my testers who stated that instead of having to exit out of the page after viewing the abstract or citation and then click on the full paper to access the full paper, they would have liked a direct way to access the full research article for papers that they liked. Also, they would like to access citations, abstract, and the full paper without having to exit out of their current window. I learned that users need to be able to speedily access all parts of the wireframe using the least amount of clicks possible, and that convenience and speed is incredibly important, especially for work intensive tasks such as research. As a result, I included links that allowed users to navigate between the abstract, citations, and full paper in the interactive prototype linked above.
