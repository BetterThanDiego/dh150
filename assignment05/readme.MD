Persona 1



Demographics: Natalie, aged 21, undergraduate researcher at a university trying to pursue a career in healthcare
Motivations, Needs: To learn research for a successful career
Goals: To efficiently survey, read, and cite research
Barriers and Facilitators: Vast research libraries can be intimidating, especially for someone new in the field of research. She may also have low technical and research literacy. However, she has a variety of off-site tools to help her (for example, she could easily look how to use Pubmed).
Empathy Map (Feel, think, act, or say): She feels intimidated by Pubmed’s professional community, but thinks that becoming proficient with the website is a gateway to becoming better at research. She will likely ask for help or say that Pubmed is difficult to use.

Feature: Automatic and accessible citation tool.

Scenario Context (Why, setting, personas, goals): Although accessing, reading, and downloading publications and articles are easy, many researchers and professionals need an accurately formatted citation for their readings to be useful. This may help them achieve their goal of performing research effectively.
Scenario Use Cases (Action, tasks, events): User types in the search bar any research of interest. The system shows relevant articles and the user scrolls to find a research article of interest. Nearby the link to that article appears a citation tool button labeled “Citation”. The user presses the button and receives a prompt with the citation in many formats. The user is happy to find it successful.

Journey Map (Challenge, frustration, possible solution, actions to accomplish): Natalie would like to review and cite work on traumatic brain injury to better prepare for an interview in a research lab. However, the citation tool is often hidden inside the article website’s interface, which may be proprietary depending on the publisher of this article. Some publishers do not release a citation and must be created manually. She is frustrated that her research process is slowed by a manual citation process. One possible solution is to have a citation button readily transparent as soon as the reader finds an article. For example, the citation button can be nearby the article name after searching for a research topic of interest when scrolling relevant articles. To accomplish this action, Natalie will look for the box labeled “Cite” and will see the citation in many formats.

Person 2



Demographics: Dr. Wilson, aged 40, family medicine physician at a primary care clinic
Motivations, Needs: To stay on top of current research to better serve his patients and clinic
Goals: To view current and key research in his area of medicine efficiently and effectively.
Barriers and Facilitators: May not have enough time to search through the many steps to read an article, but is an expert in the medical terminology to read his desired research interest.
Empathy Map (Feel, think, act, or say): Feels like Pubmed is inefficient and slow, and thinks that it can be difficult to access research because it takes so long. Acts to continue to use Pubmed because it is a unifying program for all research. He says that the research process is not easy but it’s an important part of doing the best for his patients’ care.

Feature: Scrolling for search results provides the summary or abstract of an article under the title so that researchers can easily determine if the article of interest is worthy of further reading.

Scenario Context (Setting, personas, goals): Clinicians seeking to learn more about current research may become frustrated with Pubmed because it takes many clicks and destinations to finally reach the text of an article of interest. Their goals may be stifled by this inefficient process.
Scenario Use Cases (Action, tasks, events): The user types in their research interest in the search bar and scrolls for articles of interest in the search results. When scrolling for relevant articles, under the title is a brief truncated summary or abstract text of the article. The user is happy that time is saved and either clicks on the article link to read more or moves on to the next article title and text to determine if it may be useful for their practice.

Journey Map (Challenge, frustration, possible solution, actions to accomplish): Clinicians may experience challenges when searching through vast amounts of publications and articles to find the research they need to improve their basis of understanding medicine. They may be frustrated that useful text such as abstracts and summaries are deeply embedded with the web page. One possible solution is to display abstracts and summaries immediately below publication titles in the search results. To accomplish this action, users may simply type in their research interests in the toolbar and search for titles and abstracts that seem useful to them.

Person 3



Demographics: Dr. Kim, aged 30, PhD research in a basic sciences laboratory
Motivations, Needs: To expand upon the research field of cancer genetics and contribute useful scientific information to the medical community and general public
Goals: To read and search research articles are comprehensively as possible but also as efficiently as possible
Barriers and Facilitators: May be impeded by the many web pages and web links needed to access articles. However, expertise in areas of interest may also help researchers navigate complex research terminology.
Empathy Map (Feel, think, act, or say): She feels that it can be difficult and time intensive to skim research articles, especially after clicking so many buttons to reach the article. She thinks that it is too time intensive. However, since Pubmed is an exhaustive resource, she acts and uses it anyway to access research information. Says that Pubmed is a useful collective and collaborative resource effort regardless of its shortcomings.

Feature: Bolding or highlighting of search bar terminology within publication and article text

Scenario Context (Setting, personas, goals): Researchers attempting to quickly read and search articles may be frustrated because there may not be enough onsite tools to facilitate skimming and speed reading, especially when opening articles may already be time intensive. The goal is to have a bolding or highlighting to help guide readers in finding pertinent information.
Scenario Use Cases (Action, tasks, events): The user enters in the search bar any word or phrase as their research interest. Then, the user scrolls down the search results to find an interesting article and clicks on it. The system then proceeds to show the user the article’s text. When reading, the system highlights or bolds any text that was included in the user’s search entry. The user is pleased that skimming research articles is now easier and faster.

Journey Map (Challenge, frustration, possible solution, actions to accomplish): Dr. Kim is challenged to stay up-to-date with her research interests to better inform her research projects and work. To do so, she may read and skim many articles but still would like a comprehensive understanding on them. She is frustrated that long articles may take a long time to read, and pertinent information from her search query may be difficult to find. One possible solution is for the system to highlight all words and phrases from the search bar within the text, so that readers may easily find their text of interest even within unrelated articles and publications that may mention it. To accomplish this action, readers will simply continue to read article texts but their eyes may be attracted to bolded or highlighted words or phrases of interest according to their search results.
