DH150 Assignment01: Pubmed Heuristic Evaluation by Andrew Nguyen DH 150

Motivation + description of the community of your choice: Pubmed is a major database and community for academic research in medicine. Public health is dependent on the ongoing updates and new developments that research delivers it, and keeping the public up-to-date on this information is vital to improving patient care and health. Publications and updates follow the ever-changing healthcare landscape, and maintaining an efficient forum to discuss topics and discoveries is foundational to the effectiveness of research. A heuristic evaluation of the website's design interface can determine its usefulness in showing health information and facilitating research creation, submission, and retrieval.

Brief Information: Pubmed is a free resource by the National Center of Biotechnology Information and the National Institute of Health that holds over 30 million peer reviewed literature articles covering the life sciences, healthcare, and bioengineering. Publishers and journals may submit work from their respective contributors and share their research with the Pubmed community.

Overall Evaluation: Overall, Pubmed appears to be a usable web application with reasonable usage of design heuristics.

Brief evaluation of the web/app - overall impression and ux issues you found that you can imporve.

1: Visibility of system status. Severity rating: 3

There is an exhaustive resource list, popular resources, news and blog, and search option categories to navigate on the home page. Clicking on these items often leads to a different home page for another website, which can be disorienting to the user. Within each of these categories lies many different databases, and users can get lost when trying to view their needed databases. Visibility of system status is not transparent and the user cannot predict where links will eventually lead them to the information they are looking for. The URL does not provide this information, and there is no display that shows where the user is located within the web application. Besides traditional browser controls, it is difficult for users to understand the system status.


2: Match between system and the real world. Severity rating: 1

Pubmed is geared towards resarchers, scientists, and medical professionals. It appropriately tailors its design interface with vocabulary that is familiar to these groups. Since its information is populated by the same groups that read it, there is little descrepancy in language, words, phrases, or concepts. Information is presented as expected. Browsing research papers using the search bar is shown by title in order of relevance. Clicking on a title reveals a short abstract. This convention is as expected, as if searching for any piece of literature online or in a catalog.

3: User control and freedom. Severity rating: 2

It is difficult to feel in control using Pubmed's design interface. Although traditional browsers back and forward controls exist, there is no "emergency exit", allowing users to navigate back and forth between pages. However, the user is able to click back to the home page directly using the 
"Pubmed.gov" image on the upper left, but due to the complexity and length of possible pathways, its frustrating to not be able to reverse to previous pages. The Search Bar option is free and easy to use, however.

4: Consistency and standards. Severity rating: 3
Example: button label (login-), function of icon (go back to home), location of the icon/menu/layout

5: Error prevention. Severity rating: 3
Example: booking system that prevents the previous date to the departure,warning messsage about duplicated filename, password setting

6: Recognition rather than recall. Severity rating: 3
Example: 404 error (code errors), autofill

7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
Example: short cut, copy+paste

8: Aesthetic and minimalist design. Severity rating: 3
Example: bad background design

9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. Severity rating: 3
Example: required field*, internet connection warning, (404 error)

10: Help and documentation. Severity rating: 3
Example: help page, faq form, search, find out more -- chat/online help, provide tour/training.
