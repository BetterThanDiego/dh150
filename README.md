DH150 Assignment01: Pubmed Heuristic Evaluation by Andrew Nguyen DH 150

Motivation + description of the community of your choice: Pubmed is a major database and community for academic research in medicine. Public health is dependent on the ongoing updates and new developments that research delivers it, and keeping the public up-to-date on this information is vital to improving patient care and health. Publications and updates follow the ever-changing healthcare landscape, and maintaining an efficient forum to discuss topics and discoveries is foundational to the effectiveness of research. A heuristic evaluation of the website's design interface can determine its usefulness in showing health information and facilitating research creation, submission, and retrieval.

Brief Information: Pubmed is a free resource by the National Center of Biotechnology Information and the National Institute of Health that holds over 30 million peer reviewed literature articles covering the life sciences, healthcare, and bioengineering. Publishers and journals may submit work from their respective contributors and share their research with the Pubmed community.

Overall Evaluation: Overall, Pubmed appears to be a usable web application with reasonable usage of design heuristics.

Brief evaluation of the web/app - overall impression and ux issues you found that you can imporve.

1: Visibility of system status. Severity rating: 3

There is an exhaustive resource list, popular resources, news and blog, and search option categories to navigate on the home page. Clicking on these items often leads to a different home page for another website, which can be disorienting to the user. Within each of these categories lies many different databases, and users can get lost when trying to view their needed databases. Visibility of system status is not transparent and the user cannot predict where links will eventually lead them to the information they are looking for. The URL does not provide this information, and there is no display that shows where the user is located within the web application. However, the usage of regular 


2: Match between system and the real world
Example: Left-Right sign, bad elevator buttons

3: User control and freedom
Example: No Exit

4: Consistency and standards
Example: button label (login-), function of icon (go back to home), location of the icon/menu/layout

5: Error prevention
Example: booking system that prevents the previous date to the departure,warning messsage about duplicated filename, password setting

6: Recognition rather than recall
Example: 404 error (code errors), autofill

7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
Example: short cut, copy+paste

8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
Example: bad background design

9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
Example: required field*, internet connection warning, (404 error)

10: Help and documentation
Example: help page, faq form, search, find out more -- chat/online help, provide tour/training.
