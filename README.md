## 1) PubMed Redesign
DH 150 Andrew Nguyen Winter 2020


## 2) Introduction: a brief information about the project.

 [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) is a free resource by the National Center of Biotechnology Information and the National Institute of Health that holds over 30 million peer reviewed literature articles covering the life sciences, healthcare, and bioengineering. Publishers and journals may submit work from their respective contributors and share their research with the Pubmed community. As a result, Pubmed is a major database and community for academic research in medicine. Public health is dependent on the ongoing updates and new developments that research delivers it, and keeping the public up-to-date on this information is vital to improving patient care and health. Publications and updates follow the ever-changing healthcare landscape, and maintaining an efficient forum to discuss topics and discoveries is foundational to the effectiveness of research. This project offers three solutions to redesign Pubmed's interface to better optimize these activities.

## 3) Clear Design Statement:

The main activity that users will try to do using Pubmed is citing, opening, and searching research articles. However, due to PubMed's complexity to cater to various medical and research professionals, it can be disorienting and confusing to use if users are not familiar with its interface. Many tools critical in using PubMed are not readily available, and are instead often nestled deep inside article web pages rather than immediately accessible from the interface. Additionally, it may be difficult to readily find pertinent search information due to the comprehensive nature of PubMed's website structure and research text. The solution to satisfy this need is to provide citation, abstract viewing, and bolding or highlighting of keyword terminology in-text to effectively cite, open, and search articles for research in an area of interest.

The following three features are focused on to best optimize the user experience:

### Feature 1: Automatic and accessible citation tool.

### Feature 2: Scrolling for search results provides the summary or abstract of an article under the title so that researchers can easily determine if the article of interest is worthy of further reading.

### Feature 3: Bolding or highlighting of search bar terminology within publication and article text.

It is important to resolve these issues in maintaining and updating a user-friendly forum that discuss topics and discoveries that are foundational to the effectiveness of research. Public health is dependent on the ongoing updates and new developments that research delivers it, and keeping the public up-to-date on this information is vital to improving patient care and health. Publications and updates follow the ever-changing healthcare landscape, and striving for an accessible and optimized user experience helps facilitate this goal.


## 4) Competitor analysis:

Overall, [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) appears to be a usable web application with reasonable usage of design heuristics. However, due to its complexity to cater to various medical and research professionals, it can be disorienting and confusing to use if users are not familiar with its interface. Because Pubmed is a large collaborative project, many design inconsistencies are also present.

## 5) User Research:

Contextual inquiry is incredibly informative on how users think and interpret UX / UI design. As a designer, it may seem intuitive or simple on how to perform normal functions. But at the end of the day, UX / UI design exists to serve users, and should be approache das such. Target users are researchers, scientists, and clinicians working in the health field. Demographics are young to older adults, who prefer efficient and comprehensive modes to access information. Users are likely experts in their respective health and scientific fields. The users can traditionally do these activities at a library or alternatively on Pubmed. To complete this activity, users would type their subject of interest in the search bar, scroll for any interesting articles, open that aricle, and cite that source as needed for research purposes.

## 6) UX storytelling:

Students, clinicians, and researchers are different personas that may use PubMed. Understanding the perspective of each persona helps develop practical and functional improvements in the new application. We follow the story of three individuals, Natalie, Dr. Wilson, and Dr. Kim, who try to understand their perspective in the PubMed user experience. For each user, we propose a new function in response to user experience scenarios through journey maps. Read [personas and scenarios](https://github.com/andmnguyen/dh150/tree/master/assignment05).

## 8) Low-fidelity prototype:

The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to determine the overall functionality of the application prior to the design process. Common personas kept in mind during this process are students, clinicians, and scientific researchers that are hoping to cite, search, and survey research literature. Read more about the [low fidelity prototype](https://github.com/andmnguyen/dh150/tree/master/assignment06).

A list of tasks that this wireflow supports:

Feature 1: Automatic and accessible citation tool.

Feature 2: Scrolling for search results provides the summary or abstract of an article under the title so that researchers can easily determine if the article of interest is worthy of further reading.

Feature 3: Bolding or highlighting of search bar terminology within publication and article text.

## 9) High-fidelity prototype

The purpose and process of prototyping is to determine the overall functionality of the application prior to the design process and perform revisions to best optimize the user experience. A list of tasks that this prototype supports:

Feature 1: Automatic and accessible citation tool.

Feature 2: Scrolling for search results provides the summary or abstract of an article under the title so that researchers can easily determine if the article of interest is worthy of further reading.

Feature 3: Bolding or highlighting of search bar terminology within publication and article text.

## 10) Optional evaluation and revision history 
Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)

See the [cognitive walkthrough video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p_r7SAc38xTgsVAlPdaLGJsTjSwkqdJi/view?usp=sharing) and [impression test video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NZkgxMos3SafZfGmAQhiWRmt4-F-AKBM/view?usp=sharing). View the [accessibility audit](https://github.com/andmnguyen/dh150/tree/master/assignment08).

The wireframe passed accessibility tests for color contrast as seen in this photo (only the built-in Adobe interface that hosts the wirframe failed, which is not a part of the wireframe and is not part of the user experience; see photo).

Read more about [usability testing](https://github.com/andmnguyen/dh150/tree/master/assignment02).

During this test, I learned that usability testing requires a lot of patience. Although it can be easy to rush through the design process, it is important to cross-check work with users, especially because they are ultimately the audience of the website or application. What worked was carefully and methodically preparing the video materials, such as the script and Google Forms. However, I think that these steps could be improved by possibly involving more and different demographics of users to test how different people and groups may react to the website design interface. Also, perhaps more questions specific to the kinds of demographics may be useful. For example, questions for parents may involve: "Do you agree or disagree that this interface is helpful for most parents?" I would like to improve UT by making questions tailored to expected audience groups. Read more about [prototype revisions](https://github.com/andmnguyen/dh150/tree/master/assignment08).

Previously, when viewing the citation and abstract pages in the search results, users could not navigate between citation, abstract, and the full research article from the citation and abstract pages. This was a frustrating experience for my testers who stated that instead of having to exit out of the page after viewing the abstract or citation and then click on the full paper to access the full paper, they would have liked a direct way to access the full research article for papers that they liked. Also, they would like to access citations, abstract, and the full paper without having to exit out of their current window. I learned that users need to be able to speedily access all parts of the wireframe using the least amount of clicks possible, and that convenience and speed is incredibly important, especially for work intensive tasks such as research. As a result, I included links that allowed users to navigate between the abstract, citations, and full paper in the interactive prototype linked above.

## 11) conclusion: what you learned throughout the process

For me, the most important learning experience throughout this process was that UX / UI is far more than creating a nice design. I came into the course thinking that I was going to learn how to create aesthetic designs, but UX / UI turned out to be much more complex. Rather, it is a workflow that supports a sustainable and productive relationship between designer and user that is ultimately user oriented. Although it may seem like so many tedious steps, each step breaks down the creation process to one that places users first. From the impression tests to journey maps, we must place ourselves as close to the the user as possible to understand their mindset. As a result, although the interface may be appear the focus, UX / UI is really just a conduit for users to perform the functions that they'd like to do. In this way, the forefront of UX / UI isn't really UX / UI, but the users themselves. This user oriented approach is not easy, and requires patience, systematic practice, and teamwork with users. Moving forward, I'd like to keep these ideas in mind to structure how I perform UI / UX work, and hope to continue to apply them to create great and efficent designs.
