DH150 Assignment01: Pubmed Heuristic Evaluation by Andrew Nguyen DH 150
Motivation + description of the community of your choice: Pubmed is a major database and community for academic research in medicine. Public health is dependent on the ongoing updates and new developments that research delivers it, and keeping the public up-to-date on this information is vital to improving patient care and health. Publications and updates follow the ever-changing healthcare landscape, and maintaining an efficient forum to discuss topics and discoveries is foundational to the effectiveness of research. A heuristic evaluation of the website's design interface can determine its usefulness in showing health information and facilitating research creation, submission, and retrieval.
