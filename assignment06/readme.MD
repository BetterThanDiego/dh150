A brief description of your project: My project is UI / UX revision of Pubmed. Pubmed is a free resource by the National Center of Biotechnology Information and the National Institute of Health that holds over 30 million peer reviewed literature articles covering the life sciences, healthcare, and bioengineering. Publishers and journals may submit work from their respective contributors and share their research with the Pubmed community. The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to determine the overall functionality of the application prior to the design process. Common personas kept in mind during this process are students, clinicians, and scientific researchers that are hoping to cite, search, and survey research literature.



A list of tasks that the paper prototype of your system supported:

Feature 1: Automatic and accessible citation tool.

Feature 2: Scrolling for search results provides the summary or abstract of an article under the title so that researchers can easily determine if the article of interest is worthy of further reading.

Feature 3: Bolding or highlighting of search bar terminology within publication and article text.



Wireframe and wireflow:

A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype:

In terms of overall feedback, I would try to create my wireframe and wireflow larger and try to make my handwriting a little bit more clear for test users to practice on the prototype. I would solve this problem by perhaps using a larger space for each wireframe page, and making the spaces between each wireframe larger. Another issue was that because the wireframes were intended to focus entirely on the functionality of the three functions discussed above, many other tools typically included in Pubmed, such as different search options and searching for authors, were not included. Given the space using a handwritten wireframe, itâ€™s difficult to keep all the details from the original Pubmed desktop application. Next time, I think using a larger wireframe may help make all of its tools more clear and visible. Other than that, my test user said that the directions and flow of the prototype were clear and intuitive, and that it introduced many quality of life changes to the original Pubmed if introduced. The tester was able to complete all tasks.
