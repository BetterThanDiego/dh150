#DH150 assignment 02 Usability testing

##description

The purpose of Usability Testing (UT) is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of design interfaces when using a website or application. Studies show that having up to 5 different people testing an application can reveal 85% of major issues. Heuristic and usability tests can are an important part of the design process, and its solutions can bring more people, revenue, and value to an application.

Based on the Heuristic Evaluation, I would like to test how easy or difficult it is to perform usual functions researchers and clinicians would like to do when using Pubmed. For example: Look up recent research, cite articles, and determine the health efficacy of drugs and medicine. These are normal everyday activities that people should be able to do easily on Pubmed. These tests will determine the effectivness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the design interface.

During this test, I learned that usability testing requires a lot of patience. Although it can be easy to rush through the design process, it is important to cross-check work with users, especially because they are ultimately the audience of the website or application. What worked was carefully and methodically preparing the video materials, such as the script and Google Forms. However, I think that these steps could be improved by possibly involving more and different demographics of users to test how different people and groups may react to the website design interface. Also, perhaps more questions specific to the kinds of demographics may be useful. For example, questions for parents may involve: "Do you agree or disagree that this interface is helpful for most parents?" I would like to improve UT by making questions tailored to expected audience groups.
