Description of project design challenge, target users, research method(s).

The main activity that users will try to do using Pubmed is searching, opening, and citing research articles. The highest basic need is self-actualization, in which the user is seeking to develop abilities and talents to pursue their career and research goals. The traditional solution to satisfy this need is to effectively and comprehensively search, open, and cite articles for research in an area of interest. Digital technology facilitates this need by allowing the search of millions of articles simultaneously, and providing automated processes to gather and cite these articles for use.

Target users are researchers, scientists, and clinicians working in the health field. Demographics are young to older adults, who prefer efficient and comprehensive modes to access information. Users are likely experts in their respective health and scientific fields. The users can traditionally do these activities at a library or alternatively on Pubmed. To complete this activity, users would type their subject of interest in the search bar, scroll for any interesting articles, open that aricle, and cite that source as needed for research purposes.

I select participatory observation. I will observe user activity by asking them how or why they are doing what they are doing. I will include questions such as: How would you know what to do? and When would you normally perform this task? I will let the user show me how to use the program.

I will visit a hospital where a student intern is doing research. I will observe an intern working on a research article and ask them to search, find, and cite sources for their work. I will interact by interviewing the student, discussing their actions, and having them speak their thoughts aloud. I will collect user data with a voice / video recording. I will also prepare an interview guide.

Your interview transcript or observation notes

Could you please tell us your name a little bit about what you do?

I'm Kaitlyn Pham I'm a third year Cog Sci student and I'm involved in a few things on campus. I'm part of the UCLA equestrian team, involved in research focusing on the biochemical processes of depression.

So where do you usually use your computer?

In class or at my desk at home.

What do you usually use it for?

Taking notes and messing around on the internet.

Is this the only computer that you use?

Yes.

Do you usually share with other people?

No.

How much do time do you think you use your computer?

7 hours a day.

Do you browse the web on your mobile phone?

Yes.

Can you guess how long you've used the application Pubmed?

10 minutes a day, depending on if I'm doing something research related. It can take up to two hours.

How well does that kind of search work on the computer?

Well.

So you usually have success when searching up this information?

Yes.

When you usually look this stuff up, what kind of information are you looking for?

Typically depression, neural networks, or scientific stuff.

Let's do some sample searches. When you're using these tasks, you're going to use the Pubmed site. Please think aloud. Try to find more information about traumatic brain injury.

So I'm going to start with the search bar.

What made you think about this task?

That's the most broad thing I could start with - just looking for a traumatic brain injury article. I'm probably going to look for the search results.

How do you decide what key words to use in the search bar?

Typically whatever topic I'm looking up. If I'm looking up depression and sleep I will look up depression and sleep.

What key words are you looking for?

I'm trying not to look for ones that describe specific links like dementia - those may not be general enough. I'm looking for traumatic brain injury in the title.

I see that you're navigating to the sort the articles by best matches. Do you think best matches will help you find what you need?

Yes, I'll look at current treatment strategies and future endeavors.

So do you think that this page will tell you good info about TBI?

Yes, I feel like for looking for general information about TBI, something about current treatment strategies and future endeavors will give me updated and more recent info about the current strategies to treat and future directions of where the research is going.

How much time would you usually spend on a search like this?

3-4 minutes.

So you feel like you've found what you're looking for?

Yes.

Are you satisfied with the outcome of this search?

Yes.

You made the change to recent match from best match. Why did you make this choice?

Recent match gives the most recent info that is published, but doesn't provide a general outlook. It's more about TBI and its links to other disorders that may be too specific. If you search best matches it will probably have more general articles.

Do you ever save you searches? If so how?

I have a pretty informal way. I usually just have a google docs open with all of my current research links and I just copy and paste them there.

Do you think that method works well or not so well?

I think it works well, I just copy and paste the article with the abstract for a quick glance.

Have you ever had difficulty refinding that info again?

Yes, when I forget to copy and paste it.

Have you ever had any problems when trying to find a particular article?

Sometimes when I'm looking for something really specific, sometimes it will target the keywords in the body and not the title when in reality I'm looking for a more specific article in the title.

Are there any specific techniques or tricks to help you find what you're looking for?

No, I just sort through it.

Do you usually use any social sites like forums or groups to help you find what you need or do you use Pubmed directly?

I usually use Pubmed directly or I'll use Google Scholar. What I do is find what is cited or what articles cite that article.

Can you tell me about a research task that took a long time?

Yes, when I'm not clear what I'm searching for and I need to narrow down what I'm talking about. Sometimes I'll just find broad articles and not really think about what I'm searching for until I get more information about them.

If you could create a magical tool that would allow you to find any information that you want, what tool would it be and how would it work?

Google Scholar is close to that magical tool for because it searches many database at once. I want Google Scholar but organized by best matches, or i can filter by keyword in the title or body or most recent. I'd lalso want it to more easily show the full article and the abstract in the search. If I click the link it should take me to the full article immediately, somtimes I'll spend a whole five minutes looking for the article.

Thank you for your time.

Yes.

Short reflection on what you learned and what you will do differently in the future

In summary, I learned that contextual inquiry takes a lot of time and patience. Its challenging to go through all the steps to write a script, find an interviewee, record the video and transcript, and reflect on their experiences. Its also difficult to not provide hints and try to help the user. However, its also incredibly informative on how users think and interpret UX / UI design. As a designer, it may seem intuitive or simple on how to perform normal functions. But at the end of the day, UX / UI design exists to serve users, and should be approache das such. In the future, I wish to include more actions for the user to perform so that I can better understand how they expect their programs to work. I also would like to ask more than one user to test my website so that I can see if other barriers exist that prevent them from using the program the way that they would like it to be used.
