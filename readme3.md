Description of project design challenge, target users, research method(s).

The main activity that users will try to do using Pubmed is searching, opening, and citing research articles. The highest basic need is self-actualization, in which the user is seeking to develop abilities and talents to pursue their career and research goals. The traditional solution to satisfy this need is to effectively and comprehensively search, open, and cite articles for research in an area of interest. Digital technology facilitates this need by allowing the search of millions of articles simultaneously, and providing automated processes to gather and cite these articles for use.

Target users are researchers, scientists, and clinicians working in the health field. Demographics are young to older adults, who prefer efficient and comprehensive modes to access information. Users are likely experts in their respective health and scientific fields. The users can traditionally do these activities at a library or alternatively on Pubmed. To complete this activity, users would type their subject of interest in the search bar, scroll for any interesting articles, open that aricle, and cite that source as needed for research purposes.

I select participatory observation. I will observe user activity by asking them how or why they are doing what they are doing. I will include questions such as: How would you know what to do? and When would you normally perform this task? I will let the user show me how to use the program.

I will visit a hospital where a student intern is doing research. I will observe an intern working on a research article and ask them to search, find, and cite sources for their work. I will interact by interviewing the student, discussing their actions, and having them speak their thoughts aloud. I will collect user data with a voice / video recording. I will also prepare an interview guide.

Short reflection on what you learned and what you will do differently in the future

In summary, I learned that contextual inquiry takes a lot of time and patience. Its challenging to go through all the steps to write a script, find an interviewee, record the video and transcript, and reflect on their experiences. Its also difficult to not provide hints and try to help the user. However, its also incredibly informative on how users think and interpret UX / UI design. As a designer, it may seem intuitive or simple on how to perform normal functions. But at the end of the day, UX / UI design exists to serve users, and should be approache das such. In the future, I wish to include more actions for the user to perform so that I can better understand how they expect their programs to work. I also would like to ask more than one user to test my website so that I can see if other barriers exist that prevent them from using the program the way that they would like it to be used.
